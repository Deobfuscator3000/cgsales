<p class="Title_Blue">TRANSFERRING ADDRESSES</p>
      <p class="fontboldblack"><a name="Transferring"></a><span class="parahead">Transferring
          Addresses to Other Programs</span></p>
      <ul>
        <p>Looking Up and Searching for addresses is only useful if the data
          can be easily transferred to other programs - like word processors,
          spreadsheets or databases. Postcode offers a choice of powerful ways
          to transfer data easily to almost any Windows program where it will
          be used:</p>
      </ul>
      <p class="fontboldblack"><span class="parahead">Robot</span></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>This is the simplest way to transfer an address to your program, as
          you simply type a postcode into almost any Windows application, Robot
          does the rest.&nbsp; See <a class="link_blue" href="robotfrm.htm#using">Using
          The Robot</a> for more details.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="fontboldblack"><a name="Clipboard"></a><span class="parahead">Clipboard</span></p>
      <ul>
        <p>One of the most basic ways to transfer data is to use the Windows
          Clipboard.<br>
            <br>
    Simply find the address you require, select it from the <a class="link_blue" href="resfrm.htm">Results
    List</a>, then select the Edit menu Copy option (shortcut key [Ctrl]+C).
    The selected address is copied to the clipboard, using the current settings
    and it is then available for pasting into your chosen program.<br>
    <br>
    Move to your chosen application, then paste the address into position. Pasting
    will usually be carried out in your application by using an Edit menu Paste
    option (shortcut key [Ctrl]+V) - but consult your application's documentation
    for further details.<br>
    <br>
    Although this method requires almost no setting up - and may well be all
    you need for simple word-processing - there are more powerful methods of
    transferring addresses, which give you much more control of the process -
    including the format of the address.<br>
    <br>
    The format of the address placed on the Clipboard can be adjusted using many
    of the <a class="link_blue" href="#Insert Settings">Insert Settings</a>, and <a class="link_blue" href="#LineSqueeze">Line
    Squeeze</a> features- see below.</p>
      </ul>
      <p class="fontboldblack"><a name="DragDrop"></a><span class="parahead">Drag &amp; Drop</span></p>
      <ul>
        <p>The <a class="link_blue" href="labfrm.htm#DragDrop">Label Tab</a> provides
    a quick way of dragging addresses and barcodes to other Windows programs
    - like Microsoft Word.<br>
    <br>
    To drag a barcode or address, simply hold down a [Shift] key, then click
    and hold down the LEFT mouse button on either the barcode or the address
    box of the Label Tab. Keep the mouse button down whilst dragging onto the
    target program (like Word), then release the mouse button to drop a copy
    of the barcode or address into that program.</p>
      </ul>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images\wordaddr.gif" width="562" height="419"></p>
      <ul>
        <p>Please note:&nbsp; The Barcode is a graphical image and you should
          ensure that your target program is able to receive and use graphical
          data, before dragging it there. The Royal Mail barcode is subject to
          a fairly strict specification of size and layout. You should ensure
          that your target program is set up to print the barcode to this specification.</p>
      </ul>
      <p class="fontboldblack"><a name="Insert"></a><span class="parahead">Insert</span></p>
      <ul>
        <p>Postcode can pass address information to almost any Windows programs
          by simulating the typing of keystrokes into that program. You have
          full control over the order in which fields are typed into your program,
          and Postcode includes a very powerful keystroke 'macro' language which
          enables Postcode to control everything that happens during Insert -
          including the precise position of where each field will be typed.<br>
            <br>
    A special Insert menu is provided to carry out the insert process, and when
    Postcode starts up, it examines all the other programs currently running,
    and provides an entry in this menu for each one, along with a menu hot key
    1-9 and A-Z.</p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images\pcmain9.gif" width="451" height="454"></p>
        <p>If your application was started after Postcode was loaded, it will
          be necessary to refresh the Insert menu by selecting Insert Refresh
          (shortcut key [F5]). Note that it would be unhelpful to type addresses
          into some types of Windows programs (eg Windows Explorer!) - and Postcode
          tries to ignore many of these.<br>
            <br>
    To Insert an address, first select it from the <a class="link_blue" href="resfrm.htm">Results
    List</a>, then choose the target program from the Insert menu - and the address
    will be typed in according to the current Postcode settings.</p>
        <p>Use the Edit menu &quot;Editable Results&quot; option if you wish
          to be able to change data other than adding property and organisation
          on the Results Tab before inserting it into other applications.&nbsp; This
          menu setting is stored with the current settings file.&nbsp; If &quot;Editable
          Results&quot; is not checked, you cannot enter a new search request
          in the Results Tab.&nbsp; In this case if you type in any of the Results
          Tab boxes you will be returned to the appropriate box on the Search
          Tab.<br>
            <br>
    Once you have carried out the first Insert, Postcode remembers your target
    program, and makes a new entry at the top of the Insert menu - with a shortcut
    key [F2]. This means that future addresses can be inserted into this program
    simply by selecting an address, then pressing [F2].<br>
    <br>
    For even faster Insert of addresses, once the first Insert has been completed,
    simply double-click an address in the <a class="link_blue" href="resfrm.htm">Results
    List </a> (this feature is not available if DDE is in use - see below).<br>
    <br>
    The behaviour of Postcode during Insert is controlled by settings for each
        application.&nbsp; Please see the section below that describes how to
        use the Wizard to configure Insert for your application. </p>
      </ul>
      <p class="fontboldblack"><a name="Insert Settings"></a><span class="parahead">Insert
      and Robot Settings Wizard</span></p>
      <ul>
        <p>When Postcode is first installed, it should Insert into most common
          programs - like Word or Excel - correctly. Postcode has a very powerful
          keystroke 'macro' language, which can be made to control your target
          program, and the precise position of where the data will be typed.</p>
        <p>To configure an application to work with Postcode, select the 'Insert
        / Robot Setup' option from the File menu.</p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images\insert1.gif" width="393" height="317"></p>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p><a class="link_blue" href="#Teach">Show AFD Robot How</a><i>&nbsp;<br>
        </i>This is the simplest mode to configure AFD Postcode to work with
        your application.&nbsp; Simply ensure your application is ready to
        accept the address and then click the 'Show AFD Robot How'
        button.&nbsp; You will then be prompted to type a sample address into
        your application and AFD Robot will learn from you to ensure that
        this is the last time you have to manually type an address into your
        application.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <p><a class="link_blue" href="#Tell">Tell AFD Robot How</a><i><br>
        </i>This mode will guide you
        through step-by-step to get your application working, you select your
        application and tell AFD Postcode the keystrokes needed to move between
        fields and the fields that you wish to Insert.</p>
        <p><a class="link_blue" href="#Insert Settings Advanced">Advanced Setup</a><i><br>
        </i>Should you
        have more advanced requirements, you can fully configure all the
        settings yourself using the Advanced Setup option - you may well find it
        easiest to teach or tell AFD Postcode how to insert the address first and then use Advanced Setup to modify
        the settings if required.</p>
        <p><b><a name="Teach"></a>Show AFD Robot How</b></p>
        <p>When you select this option you will be presented with a fictitious
        address&nbsp;which you should type into your application exactly as it
        is shown.</p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images\teach.gif" width="393" height="317"></p>
        <p align="left">Please note that you should use the keyboard wherever
        possible to move between fields as this is the most reliable.&nbsp; If
        you wish to ensure that Robot moves to the first field for you then
        you should use any shortcut to move to that field before typing the
        first field.&nbsp; Robot will also record any mouse clicks you
        use, so if you are unable to use the keyboard to move to a field and
        your application does not have a scrollable window you can use the mouse
        if needed.&nbsp; You should click the 'Done' button as soon as you have
        completed entering the address to ensure that keystrokes unrelated to
        the address are not picked up.&nbsp; If you do not wish to use a field,
        e.g. county, then simply don't type it.&nbsp; If you make a mistake,
        clear out the address in your application and click the 'Start Again'
        button to start again.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><a name="TeachCust"></a>Customising Fields<br>
        </b>Should you wish to customise the field list, e.g. to add the
        Mailsort code field, then simply click the 'Customise Field List' button
        you will then be presented with the following dialog to select the
        fields to transfer:</p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images\teachfds.gif" width="393" height="317"></p>
        <p align="left">Under the 'Available Fields' caption there are options to view the
        Standard or Special fields.&nbsp; This changes the list displayed
        below.&nbsp; You can mix and match these fields by adding fields from
        either one to the 'Fields To Use' list.&nbsp; The standard fields are
        the normal Postcode fields including the current County option.&nbsp;
        The special fields are more advanced fields including the raw PAF style dependant
        thoroughfare and thoroughfare fields (this is the street split into two
        fields if there are two street names in the address), etc., the rest of
        the county field types, and the outcode and incode portions of the
        postcode (the part before and after the space respectively).&nbsp; These
        are useful for applications that store addresses in such formats.</p>
        <p align="left">You can easily transfer fields to and from the 'Fields To Use' list
        by using the arrow buttons between the two lists.&nbsp; These are used
        as follows:</p>
        <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="576">
          <tr>
            <td width="37" rowspan="4"><img border="0" src="images\fieldSel.gif" width="33" height="93"></td>
            <td width="533">Include all fields&nbsp;</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td width="533">Include the selected field(s) (from the 'Available
              Fields' List)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td width="533">Remove the selected field(s) (from the 'Fields To Use' List)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td width="533">Exclude all fields</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p align="left">
          To change the order that fields are inserted into your application,
            simply select a field and use the up and down arrows to the right
            of the 'Fields To Use' fields list to move the selected field up or down
            the list. Repeat this until you have positioned all fields in the
            order that you wish them to be inserted.&nbsp; You can also simply
        type them in a different order when typing the address in your
        application and Postcode will automatically re-order them for you.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><a name="TeachDone"></a>Completing the Process<br>
        </b>Once you have typed the address and clicked the Done button, you
        will be presented with the following final options to complete the
        setup:</p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images\teachdne.gif" width="393" height="317"></p>
        <p>Robot needs to know what to do in the case that an address has
        gaps missing, e.g. an address which does not have a locality
        present.&nbsp; In most cases you will leave this as the default 'Leave
        blank lines' setting.&nbsp; However, in some cases you may wish to
        remove the blank lines, by moving the each address field up to fill the
        gaps, e.g. with a Word Processor.&nbsp; You
        might alternatively wish to only remove blank lines between a range of fields such as the
        Street down to the Town, but you have a fixed Postcode field so you
        always want that to remain in the same place.</p>
        <p>Once you are happy with this you can click the Finish button and your
        setting will be saved and you can now use Insert and Robot with your
        application.&nbsp; Simply type a postcode into your application to see
        it work!&nbsp; If the result isn't as expected you can re-run the Wizard
        to set it up again.</p>
        <p><b><a name="Tell"></a>Tell AFD Robot How</b></p>
        <p>Once you select to 'Tell AFD Robot How', you can use the Back and Next
        buttons on each screen to go through the setup process.</p>
        <p>The steps of the wizard are as follows:</p>
        <p><b><a name="Step1"></a>Step 1: Your Application</b></p>
        <p>Here you select the window title of your application.&nbsp; This is
        used by Postcode to identify the application so that both Insert and
        Robot can use these settings when asked to insert into your
        application.&nbsp; The window title is the text that appears in the main
        blue window title bar of your application.&nbsp; This text should always
        be in the window title, and so should not necessarily be the complete
        title.&nbsp; For example, you might find Word has a title bar of
        'Document 1 - Microsoft Word', however when you save your file it could,
        for example, change to 'MyDoc.doc - Microsoft Word'.&nbsp; Therefore by
        setting the Application Window Title to 'Microsoft Word' you will ensure
        that Postcode can always recognise your application.&nbsp; If your
        application is running when you run the Wizard you should find your
        application title is listed in the drop down list box provided.&nbsp;
        Postcode will attempt to remove known document titles leaving only the
        application name, however if it has not you should alter the title
        yourself.</p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images\insert2.gif" width="393" height="317"></p>
        <p align="left">The options provided below allow you to specify a name
        for your application if desired.&nbsp; Normally you can leave the first
        option to 'Use the application window title above to identify these
        settings' as the Application Window Title will be the name of the
        application.&nbsp; However in some cases the windows title text might be
        obscure so you might prefer to choose to enter a more friendly
        application name.&nbsp; This name doesn't affect the Insert or Robot
        process itself, however it might be useful to specify a name for the
        application so that you will easily recognise it should you need to
        manually alter settings with the advanced setup.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left"><b><a name="Step2"></a>Step 2: Application Options</b></p>
        <p align="left">From this screen you can configure a number of different
        options for your application:</p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images\insert3.gif" width="393" height="317"></p>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left">The options given are as follows:</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Your application is most like a...<br>
        </b>This enables the Wizard to work out the most likely set of options
        for your application, making the subsequent steps of the wizard
        easier.&nbsp; You simply take the application type that most closely
        matches your application.&nbsp; If none of these are that close, then
        just take the one which seems closest, as you can always customise the
        setup anyway to match your application.&nbsp; The application categories
        supplied are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Wordprocessor / Envelope Label: This is an application like
            Microsoft Word or WordPerfect, were the address is entered down the
            page with each address line (e.g. Street, Locality, Town, etc.) on a
            new line.&nbsp; Or any application you are using to print a label
            for an envelope or the address portion of an envelope itself.&nbsp;
            The address is transferred down the label with each field on a new
            line.
          <li>Database / Form Entry: This refers to an application like
            Microsoft Access where fields in a table or form are used to enter
            the address.&nbsp; Or any application with separate boxes were you
            would enter each address field.&nbsp; TAB is used to move between
            the fields..
          <li>Spreadsheet: This is an application like Microsoft Excel or Lotus
            1-2-3, were the address is entered in columns for each address field
            and TAB is used to move between the fields.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Keystrokes to move between each field or line in your application<br>
        </b>This setting specifies the keystrokes to be used to move between
        fields in your application.&nbsp; The default will be dependant on the
        type of application you selected as being most like the one you are
        setting up now.&nbsp; In most cases this won't need to be changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To change or enter keystrokes in either text box you can make use of
        Postcode's powerful keyboard Macro language.&nbsp; Simply click the
        button labelled '...' to the right of the appropriate text box to be
        presented with an easy to use dialogue for specifying the keystrokes:</p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images\keysonly.gif" width="331" height="302"></p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">Clicking on any item in the list of possible keystrokes
        will add the selected item to the keystrokes to use text box.&nbsp; You
        can also type any normal keyboard key, for example letters, numbers in
        that box yourself.&nbsp; When you have entered the relevant keystroke's
        you can press OK to update the text field in the Wizard.</p>
        <p align="left">If you need to press a key with the Alt, Ctrl or Shift
        keys also pressed down you can check the boxes for this in the Wizard
        dialog, or alternatively you can select the symbols for this from the
        end of the keystrokes list on the keystrokes dialogue to apply them to
        the following keystroke.&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">To specify repeating keys, use the form {key number}.&nbsp;
        You must put a space between key and number. For example, {LEFT 4} means
        press the Left Arrow key 4 times; {TAB 3} means press the Tab key 3
        times.</p>
        <p align="left">If you need more complex settings, such as different
        keystrokes between different fields, or need to use a mouse click
        because no key shortcut is available to move to a particular field, then
        this can be altered from the
        Advanced Setup once you have completed the Wizard.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Use with Robot<br>
        </b>This specifies if your application is going to be used with Robot or
        not.&nbsp; Regardless of this setting, your settings will work with
        Insert, which is where you lookup the address in Postcode, select it and
        then select the application from the Insert menu to insert the address
        (or press F2 to insert into the last used application again).&nbsp;
        Robot functionality allows you to type the postcode directly into your
        application and then insert the full address without having to use
        Postcode directly first.&nbsp; This option is enabled by default, if you
        have no need for Robot functionality or if you are entering postcodes in
        your application and not wanting Robot triggered when you do so then you
        can opt not to use Robot with your application.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Use with Robot Fast Find<br>
        </b>This specifies if your application is going to to be used with Robot
        Fast Find or not.&nbsp; Robot Fast Find enables you to enter address
        details to be looked up directly from your application when you do not
        have the postcode.&nbsp; For example typing #Commercial Street,
        Birmingham# into your application will give you the four postcodes for
        that address to choose from.&nbsp; You can then choose the correct one
        and insert it into your application.&nbsp; Please note that as Postcode
        does not contain property data there is no way of knowing which postcode
        is the correct one for your address, but if it could help choose between
        possibilities where a postcode is hard to read on a handwritten note,
        and some streets do only have a single postcode.&nbsp; You can also
        lookup a postcode this way, e.g. #B1 1AA#, which could be useful should
        you need to enter postcodes without looking them up sometimes so the
        normal robot functionality is not suitable for you.&nbsp; In that case
        you can say no to 'Use with Robot' but yes to 'Use with Robot Fast Find'
        - that way Robot would only be triggered when you enter the postcode
        surrounded by the # symbol.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Use without prompting where possible<br>
        </b>Normally when you type a Postcode in your application, Robot will
        prompt you before inserting the address back into your
        application.&nbsp; However, if you would prefer Robot to do this
        automatically wherever possible, you can select this option and you will
        only be prompted if there is more than one possible street address for
        the postcode you enter.&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left"><b>How many fields or lines are there for address entry?<br>
        </b>This specifies how many fields (boxes) or lines there are for
        address entry into your application.&nbsp; If you are inserting into a Wordprocessor,
        an envelope label, or other free text application you should leave this
        as unlimited unless the address has to fit into a certain number of
        fields.&nbsp; If you have enough fields to cover all lines of the
        address that you will be inserting, then again it can be left as
        unlimited.&nbsp; Should you have a limited number of lines for address
        entry, for example because you are inserting into an existing
        application or database that you can't modify to fit the address, then
        specifying this will enable Postcode to ensure the address fits in the
        number of fields that your application has.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><a name="Step3"></a>Step 3: Fields To Transfer</b></p>
        <p align="left">On this screen you can specify the fields that you wish
        to be inserted into your application when you use Insert or Robot.&nbsp;
        The default fields are those from Street through to Postcode, the
        address data provided by Postcode.&nbsp; If you specified less than 5
        fields for address entry on the previous screen, the Postal County will
        not be included as it is not a required address field.&nbsp; You can add
        and remove any fields you require and if you have specified that you
        have less fields then you have mapped Postcode will attempt to fit them
        all in.&nbsp; You may wish to map Organisation and Property if your
        application has those fields as while Postcode does not contain that
        data you can enter it in Postcode yourself of comma separate it with the
        postcode with Robot (e.g. entering AFD Software Ltd,IM7 2DZ).</p>

        <p align="left"><b>Standard/Special Fields<br>
        </b>Under the 'Available Fields' caption there are options to view the
        Standard or Special fields.&nbsp; This changes the list displayed
        below.&nbsp; You can mix and match these fields by adding fields from
        either one to the 'Fields To Use' list.&nbsp; The standard fields are
        the normal Postcode fields including the current County option.&nbsp;
        The special fields are more advanced fields including the raw PAF style dependant
        thoroughfare and thoroughfare fields (this is the street split into two
        fields if there are two street names in the address), etc., the rest of
        the county field types, and the outcode and incode portions of the
        postcode (the part before and after the space respectively).&nbsp; These

      <p align="left">&nbsp;<a name="Insert Settings Advanced"></a><span class="parahead">Insert
      and Robot Advanced Setup</span></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left">For speed of setup, it is recommended that the Insert
        and Robot Wizard is used first to configure an application for use with
        the Insert and Robot features of Postcode.&nbsp; If you need to change
        anything with your settings or you have more advanced requirements,
        either due to how you wish the address to be inserted or because of the
        way the application is laid out, you can then use the Advanced Setup to
        modify your settings accordingly and use more advanced features that the
        Wizard may not include.&nbsp; You can also setup an application for
        scratch if desired using the Advanced Setup.</p>
        <p align="left">To configure an application to work with Postcode using
        the Advanced Setup elect the 'Insert
        / Robot Setup' option from the File menu.&nbsp; Then on the first Wizard
        screen select the 'Advanced Setup' button.&nbsp; The Advanced Setup
        screen will then appear:</p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images\advanced.gif" width="538" height="337"></p>
        <p align="left"><b>Selecting your Application<br>
        </b>The first thing to do is to select the application settings that you
        wish to modify.&nbsp; At the top left of this screen the 'Application'
        drop-down lists all the application settings present.&nbsp; You can use
        this to select the application you wish to modify.&nbsp; If you wish to
        add a New application without using the Wizard you can use the 'New'
        button to do this.&nbsp; The 'Remove' button can be used to delete a
        setting if required.&nbsp; If you do select the New button the following
        dialogue will appear:</p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images\newapp.gif" width="393" height="301"></p>
        <p>Here you select the window title of your application.&nbsp; This is
        used by Postcode to identify the application so that both Insert and
        Robot can use these settings when asked to insert into your
        application.&nbsp; The window title is the text that appears in the main
        blue window title bar of your application.&nbsp; This text should always
        be in the window title, and so should not necessarily be the complete
        title.&nbsp; For example, you might find Word has a title bar of
        'Document 1 - Microsoft Word', however when you save your file it could,
        for example, change to 'MyDoc.doc - Microsoft Word'.&nbsp; Therefore by
        setting the Application Window Title to 'Microsoft Word' you will ensure
        that Postcode can always recognise your application.&nbsp; If your
        application is running when you press the New button you should find your
        application title is listed in the drop down list box provided.&nbsp;
        Postcode will attempt to remove known document titles leaving only the
        application name, however if it has not you should alter the title
        yourself.</p>
        <p align="left">The options provided below allow you to specify a name
        for your application if desired.&nbsp; Normally you can leave the first
        option to 'Use the application window title above to identify these
        settings' as the Application Window Title will be the name of the
        application.&nbsp; However in some cases the windows title text might be
        obscure so you might prefer to choose to enter a more friendly
        application name.&nbsp; This name doesn't affect the Insert or Robot
        process itself, however it might be useful to specify a name for the
        application so that you will easily recognise it when altering the
        application settings.</p>
        <p align="left">The last item allows you to select existing settings to
        use as a starting point.&nbsp; You can choose not to use any (select,
        '(None)', the first item from the drop down list), but it is usually
        easier to use something as a starting point rather than starting from a
        blank set of settings.&nbsp; You should therefore use one from the most
        similar application listed.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Changing Field Mappings<br>
        </b>Field Mappings are shown in the light yellow boxes under the heading
        'Fields'.&nbsp; You can drag and drop fields from the 'Postcode Fields'
        list on the right to this list.&nbsp; Items can also be dragged off the
        list back to the 'Postcode Fields' list if you wish to remove
        them.&nbsp; Multiple Postcode fields can be dragged to a single Field in
        your application if required.</p>
        <p align="left">Above the Postcode Field's List you will see there are
        options to display Standard or Special fields.&nbsp; This option changes the list displayed
        below.&nbsp; You can mix and match these fields by adding fields from
        either one to the 'Fields To Use' list.&nbsp; The standard fields are
        the normal Postcode fields including the current County option.&nbsp;
        The special fields are more advanced fields including the raw PAF style dependant
        thoroughfare and thoroughfare fields (this is the street split into two
        fields if there are two street names in the address), etc., the rest of
        the county field types, and the outcode and incode portions of the
        postcode (the part before and after the space respectively).&nbsp; These
        are useful for applications that store addresses in such formats.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Before and After Keystrokes/Mouse Clicks<br>
        </b>To the left and right of each field respectively, you can specify
        the keystrokes that are required before and/or after the Field has been
        entered into the application.&nbsp; If a keyboard shortcut or keystroke
        is not available to move a particular field, you can also configure AFD
        Postcode to use a mouse click instead as long as the window is not
        scrollable - e.g. a website where the position to click might
        vary.&nbsp; Prior to the first field you may wish to enter
        any Before keystrokes or a mouse click that is needed to take you to the first field in
        the application to start inserting from,.&nbsp; This is especially
        useful if the application may not be
        in the correct field when Insert is used or if the postcode is not going
        to be entered in the first address field with Robot.</p>
        <p align="left">The keystrokes are specified using our fully flexible
        macro language.&nbsp; To easily select keystrokes to use for this, click
        the '...' button next to the Before or After field you are entering
        keystrokes for.&nbsp; The following dialog will then be displayed:</p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images\keys.gif" width="331" height="302"></p>
        <p align="left">Clicking on any item in the list of possible keystrokes
        will add the selected item to the keystrokes to use text box.&nbsp; You
        can also type any normal keyboard key, for example letters, numbers in
        that box yourself.&nbsp; When you have entered the relevant keystroke's
        you can press OK to update the text field on the Advanced Setup screen.</p>
        <p align="left">If you need to press a key with the Alt, Ctrl or Shift
        keys also pressed down you can select the symbols for this from the
        end of the keystrokes list on the keystrokes dialogue to apply them to
        the keystroke following the symbol.&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">To specify repeating keys, use the form {key
        number}.&nbsp; You must put
          a space between key and number. For example, {LEFT 4} means press the
          Left Arrow key 4 times; {TAB 3} means press the Tab key 3 times.</p>
        <p align="left">Should you need to use a mouse click instead, simply
        select the 'Mouse Click' option:</p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images\mouse.gif" width="331" height="302"></p>
        <p align="left">From here you can click the 'Set A New Position' button
        and then click in the field in your application that you wish to move to
        and AFD Postcode will record this for you.&nbsp; It is advisable to
        click in the middle of the field rather then near the edge.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Specifying Upper Case Fields</b>&nbsp;<br>
    For most address fields (but not for data expected always in capital letters
      - like Postcodes), Postcode will attempt to provide properly capitalised
      fields.</p>
        <p align="left"> If you prefer for one or more fields to be inserted only in Capital
          Letters, check the Case check box to the right of the After keystrokes box for
        the field(s) that you wish to Insert that field in upper
        case.&nbsp; A
          Royal Mail approved address prints the Town field in this format -
          though many typists prefer not to use this format when typing letters.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><a name="LineSqueeze"></a>Line Squeeze<br>
        </b>The 'Line Squeeze' option at the top of the dialogue applies to all
        fields mapped.&nbsp; If this option is enabled, Postcode will not insert
        any blank lines in the address (i.e. not even the Before or After
        keystrokes will be used).&nbsp; This is useful for inserting the address
        for things such as labels where blank lines aren't desirable.&nbsp; For
        formatted address entry, e.g. into a database, it is better not to use
        this functionality as address consistency can be more important.</p>
        <p align="left">Should you wish to squeeze groups of fields, for example
        you have a fixed Town and Postcode field but you wish to squeeze
        together the fields above that, then you can check the 'Squeeze' option
        to the left of the yellow field mappings text field for the consecutive
        fields that you wish to squeeze together.&nbsp; However many fields are
        mapped in the space to the right of those in the Squeeze group will be
        inserted into the number of fields that have Squeeze checked.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Additional Options</b></p>
        <p align="left">More advanced settings to allow complete flexibility
        over the way Insert and Robot work which you may require can be found by
        pressing the 'Additional Options' button at the top right of the Advanced Setup
        screen.&nbsp; This will present you with the following dialogue:</p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images\advance2.gif" width="328" height="407"></p>
        <p align="left"><b>Window Titles Associated with this Application<br>
        </b>Normally only a single window title will be associated with an
        Application.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the one you specified when you added
        the application using the Wizard or the New button on the Advanced Setup
        screen.&nbsp; In some cases however, such as that shown above which is
        the WP setting used for multiple word processors, you may wish to have
        multiple window titles associated with a single application
        setting.&nbsp; These can be added by using the 'Add' button from this
        screen.&nbsp; The Edit and Remove buttons also allow you to Edit and
        Remove window titles as required.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Settings for the Selected Window Title<br>
        </b>These settings allow you to specify options for each window title
        associated with this application.&nbsp; Where there is only one window
        title these are the application settings, however when multiple titles
        exist such as that shown above, you can specify differing settings for
        each title if desired.&nbsp; The settings given here are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p align="left"><b>Use with Robot<br>
            </b>This specifies if your application is going to be used with Robot or
        not.&nbsp; Regardless of this setting, your settings will work with
        Insert, which is where you lookup the address in Postcode, select it and
        then select the application from the Insert menu to insert the address
        (or press F2 to insert into the last used application again).&nbsp;
        Robot functionality allows you to type the postcode directly into your
        application and then insert the full address without having to use
        Postcode directly first.&nbsp; This option is enabled by default, if you
        have no need for Robot functionality or if you are entering postcodes in
        your application and not wanting Robot triggered when you do so then you
        can opt not to use Robot with your application.</li>
          <li>
            <p align="left"><b>Use with Robot Fast Find<br>
            </b>This specifies if your application is going to to be used with Robot
        Fast Find or not.&nbsp; Robot Fast Find enables you to enter address
        details to be looked up directly from your application when you do not
        have the postcode.&nbsp; For example typing #Commercial Street,
        Birmingham# into your application will give you the four postcodes for
        that address to choose from.&nbsp; You can then choose the correct one
        and insert it into your application.&nbsp; Please note that as Postcode
        does not contain property data there is no way of knowing which postcode
        is the correct one for your address, but if it could help choose between
        possibilities where a postcode is hard to read on a handwritten note,
        and some streets do only have a single postcode.&nbsp; You can also
        lookup a postcode this way, e.g. #B1 1AA#, which could be useful should
        you need to enter postcodes without looking them up sometimes so the
        normal robot functionality is not suitable for you.&nbsp; In that case
        you can say no to 'Use with Robot' but yes to 'Use with Robot Fast Find'
        - that way Robot would only be triggered when you enter the postcode
        surrounded by the # symbol.&nbsp; You can also change the # symbol to
        one more suitable for your application or convenient for you if desired.</li>
          <li>
            <p align="left"><b>Use Robot without prompting where possible<br>
            </b>Normally when you type a Postcode in your application, Robot will
        prompt you before inserting the address back into your
        application.&nbsp; However, if you would prefer Robot to do this
        automatically wherever possible, you can select this option and you will
        only be prompted if there is more than one possible street address for
        the postcode you enter.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p align="left"><b>Settings for the Selected Application<br>
        </b>These settings cover the whole application, regardless of if
        multiple window titles are selected.&nbsp; They are advanced options
        that you may wish to use to customise the way Postcode inserts data into
        your application.&nbsp; The settings given here are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p align="left"><b>Split Fields at Commas for this application<br>
            </b>This option is useful with fields that have been squeezed.&nbsp;
            It will separate fields which have comma's in them (e.g. a dependant
            street like 'Newhall Court, George Street') onto two separate
            lines.&nbsp; You may prefer this for labels or for entry into your
            application.&nbsp; We don't generally recommend this feature as it
            means your address will not be in such a consistent format (for
            example the second street in one address could be in the same place
            as a locality in another).</li>
          <li>
            <p align="left"><b>Use separate settings for Insert and Robot<br>
            </b>If enabled this option will separate the settings for Insert and
            Robot for this application.&nbsp; Normally the settings that
            Postcode will use for both Insert and Robot are the same for the
            same application.&nbsp; However if you need to have differing
            settings for each one you can do this, simply by selecting this
            option.&nbsp; When you click OK and go back to the Advanced Setup
            screen you will then see an option at the bottom left of that screen
            to switch between the settings for Insert and Robot for the
            application.&nbsp; They will default to being the same but as you
            make changes to one it will not affect the other.</li>
          <li>
            <p align="left"><b>Enable Field Length Limits<br>
            </b>This option is designed for applications with small field
            lengths.&nbsp; It allows you to specify the maximum length of each
            field you wish to Insert.&nbsp; If the field exceeds this length
            then Postcode will automatically use the most common abbreviations
            to try and reduce it's length to minimise truncation of the
            field.&nbsp; When you enable this option and click OK to go back to
            the Advanced Setup screen you will see a Length box has been added
            to specify this length for each field.&nbsp; A value of 0 means the
            field will be unlimited in length, otherwise you can specify the
            number of characters that the field can take.</li>
        </ul>
        <p align="left"><b>Default Application Settings<br>
        </b>These settings do not affect the application settings currently
        being modified, but tell Postcode what to use if no settings has been
        specified for a particular application that is used, they are also the
        settings used for determining display options in Postcode itself where
        needed.&nbsp; You can select the Default settings from the drop-down
        here.&nbsp; You can also specify if these settings will be used as the
        default for Inserting, if this is not enabled then Postcode will not
        Insert into any application that does not have settings specified for
        it.&nbsp; The setting to use the default when using Robot Fast Find also
        allows Robot Fast Find to be used with any application by using these
        default settings.

      <p class="fontboldblack"><a name="DDE"></a><span class="parahead">Dynamic
          Data Exchange (DDE)</span></p>
      <ul>
        <p>Postcode can pass information to and from another Windows program
          through Dynamic Data Exchange - even if the application has no programming
          or 'macro' language. Before DDE can operate properly, you must tell
          Postcode about the program you wish to have a DDE 'conversation' with
          - using the DDE Tab on the Postcode Property window.</p>
        <p> To set the DDE Properties, launch the Postcode Properties window
          from the File menu Properties option (shortcut key [Ctrl]+R).</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images\propdde.gif" alt="DDE Properties" width="380" height="325"></p>
        <p>The first two settings - Application and Topic tell Postcode about
          the program you wish to establish a DDE conversation with - and the
          information should be provided in the documentation of that program.
          You will see that when Postcode is installed, it is set up for use
          with Symantec's ACT v3 contact manager program.</p>
        <p> Postcode offers 12 fields of data available for a DDE conversation
          - and these are listed in the list box. For each field which you require,
          select the field, check-mark the 'Enable for DDE' checkbox, and provide
          the DDE 'Item Name' for that field.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Note:&nbsp; The 'Item Name' is the name recognised by your program
          for the Postcode field - e.g. the 'Postcode' field may be known as
          'ZipCode' to your program and your program's documentation should provide
          the 'Item Name' for you.</p>
        <p> Once you have established the DDE settings, you can start a DDE conversation
          by loading your program, then selecting the View menu Icon for DDE
          option (shortcut key [Ctrl]+D). This launches a special icon-sized
          Postcode DDE window, which can be positioned so that it appears to
          be a tool-bar button on your chosen DDE program. To move the button,
          click and hold down the RIGHT mouse button, then drag the DDE Icon
          into position before releasing the mouse button. Postcode will remember
          this position the next time the DDE Icon is used.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images\ddeicon.gif" alt="The Postcode Plus DDE Icon - use it like a toolbar button!" width="32" height="32"></p>
        <p>To read data FROM your chosen program, simply enter the data in the
          required fields within that program, then click the DDE Icon with the
          LEFT mouse button. Postcode will examine the data provided by your
          program and look up the address for you. For more complex searches,
          consider using 'Cut &amp; Paste' or 'Drag &amp; Drop' to instruct Postcode
          what you wish to search for.</p>
        <p> Once Postcode has listed results of a Lookup or Search (whether the
          data was 'collected' from your program using DDE or typed directly
          into Postcode), you can transfer an address back to your program by
          double-clicking its entry in the Results List. Using this technique
          along with your program's Insert New Record facility will also allow
          you to transfer many addresses from Postcode to your program, and so
          build up a mailing list.</p>
        <p>You can also use Iconised DDE Mode from the View menu, which works
          by taking the postcode or search you entered (Please Note:&nbsp; you
          will need to enter a $ in the postcode field of your application to
          specify a reverse search) and silently inserting back the first address
          record into the fields configured for DDE.</p>
      </ul>
      <p class="fontboldblack"><a name="API"></a><span class="parahead">Application
          Programming Interface (API)</span></p>
      <ul>
        <p>Full access to all the data within Postcode is available to programmers
          through the API. This means that for developers - and even for users
          of programs like Microsoft Access, etc, postcode lookups can be entirely
          automatic and invisible.<br>
            <br>
    Using the API will require programming ability - but AFD supply fully working
    examples (with free source code showing how this can be done) in a variety
    of popular programming languages - like Microsoft Access, Visual Basic, Delphi
    and C/C++.<br>
